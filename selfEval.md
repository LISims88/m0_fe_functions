# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?

Working with functions in JavaScript was a lesson in patience and learning how to find the answers and follow the syntax. I am most proud of the fact that even though sometimes the syntax is plainly written there may need to be changes in the way the variablea and functions are written in order to get the desired results and learning how to do so. 

- In your own words, why are functions a powerful tool in our applications?

functions are a powerful tool as they offer results for a multitude of operations and garnering results. Whether we are looking to seek truth or we are looking to manipulate the outcomes there is a method to do so, often in a plethora of ways.
